This repository contains a Streamlit-based **Document Chat Assistant**, enabling users to interact with and query content from various uploaded documents. Users can upload multiple text formats (PDF, TXT, CSV, Excel) and even a ZIP archive containing multiple documents. The application leverages [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain), [langchain-community](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) extensions, [langchain-openai](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain-openai), and OpenAI embeddings and chat models to provide semantic search and Q&A functionalities over the uploaded documents.

**Key Features:**
- **Document Upload:** Upload multiple documents or a ZIP file containing many files.
- **Semantic Search & Q&A:** Ask questions in natural language; get contextually relevant answers sourced from your documents.
- **Summarization:** Generate a global summary of all uploaded documents.
- **Metadata Awareness:** Display metadata (e.g., PDF page numbers, CSV row counts) for each source reference.
- **Model Selection:** Switch between OpenAI models (e.g., `gpt-4`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`).
- **History Management:** Clear conversation history, clear all documents, and download your chat history.

**Language Interface:**  
The UI and messages are presented in French.
